## Cinnections

Cinnections is a movie trivia game based off of the NYT's 'Connections' game. In this game, players are presented with 16 movies and tasked with grouping these movies into 4 groups of 4, each group holding one common category/theme. These categories can range from actors and directors to genres and inspirations. This game was built using React and CSS.
