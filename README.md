TODO: 
- implement 4 lives
    - game over message
    - reveal answers upon getting 4 wrong
- correct answer colors are working, however we need the answers to come together in a rectangle with enough room to reveal the category
- small features such as deselect, shuffle, having the option to select all 4 guesses before submitting
- header for aesthetics
- potentially implement a start page?
